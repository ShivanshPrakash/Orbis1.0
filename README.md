# Orbis1.0
This is definitely an improvement from DailyMotion. Still, a lot of things are left to be added. The to-do activity is still static and the single extra checkbox, which can be added from settings, have some problems.
New addition is an "answering machine" which can answer your questions (or may even predict your future... :) but it is still pretty dumb. I am currently learning natural language processing with hopes that the answering machine can be made a bit intelligent
